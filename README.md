# fare_calculator
Fare Calculator is a web-based application which calculates the approximate fare rates of different public transport mediums between a source and a destination address.

The project is live at:
http://deploymentapp.appspot.com/

Note: The calculated fares in this application are in acoordance with the standard public transport rates of Mumbai in early 2014. Since then, the rates have been hiked, and since I haven't updated the source code in accordance with the hiked transport medium rates of 2015, this application may not calculate the fare rates based on today's standards.
